I'm passionate about software and technology and am driven by the thrill of solving complex problems and developing software that can help improve the life of others.

My dream is to work for an organisation where I can make a difference by using my creativity to develop and improve technologies that have a direct effect on how people access and use information.

I love learning new languages and travelling the world, adventuring outdoors, hiking, playing beach volleyball, and working on side projects.
